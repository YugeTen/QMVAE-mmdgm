# Multimodal Variational Autoencoder
A PyTorch implementation of *Multimodal Generative Models for Scalable Weakly-Supervised Learning* (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05335). Code adapted from [original implementation](https://github.com/mhw32/multimodal-vae-public) by authors.

## Setup/Installation
Identical to [mm-dgm](https://github.com/iffsid/mm-dgm).

## How to run
Run `main.py` in `mnist_svhn/`. Results can be found in `mnist_svhn/experiments`.

## Results
See [issue #1](https://github.com/YugeTen/QMVAE-mmdgm/issues/1)
